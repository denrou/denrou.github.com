Like every operating system, a Linux based system is regularly updated.
Period between updates depends on the distribution which is used.
For example, a *rolling release* distribution such as *Arch Linux* will be continuously updated, whereas a distribution like *Fedora* will have major updates once in a while (generaly every 6 months).

I use *Fedora* for few reasons: i) I like *Gnome*, the official desktop environment; ii) it is really easy to manage; and iii) it has very recent versions of the softwares I use.

When a major update comes up, I face two possibilities:

1. upgrade the system with the built-in tools
2. re-install the whole system

Upgrading the system does not erase any program, configuration file or document.
It simply replaces programs by their newest version.
On the contrary, a fresh install will delete everything, and we get only core packages installed.

The reason I prefer the later is that it allows me to keep my system clean.
It's also the occasion to review all my documents and clean them too.

This article presents the procedure I use to upgrade the system.

## Things to do *a priori*

### Backup

It goes without saying, but it's better to say it, **a fresh install WILL erase everything on the disk.**
So I need to backup my documents and all the files I want to keep.
There are plenty of solutions to do that.
I use *rsync* because it's a simple command line tool which has prooved to be powerfull and has a good documentation.

Here's a simple script I use to make my backup:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
# Used for the name of the backup
TIME=$(date "+%y%m%d")

# Directories to backup
TO_BACKUP="/home/denis"

# Directory which will store the backup
BACKUP_TO="/données/Backup_"$TIME

# Time to backup
rsync -az $TO_BACKUP $BACKUP_TO
```

*Note:*  
The directory `/données` is a link to a hard drive which will not be erased.
Also, I only save my home directory but one could also want to save other directories such as `/usr/local/bin` or `/opt`.

### Prepare the support

This part consists in downloading [the latest version of Fedora](https://getfedora.org/fr/workstation/download/) and put it in a USB stick.
I can't simply copy the file into a USB key, because an `iso` file is just a container.
But here again, a simple command line do the job:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
dd if=~/Téléchargements/latest-fedora-version.iso of=/dev/sdX
```

where `/dev/sdX` is the path to the USB stick (usualy `sdb` or `sdc`).

Check [the official documentation](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/23/html/Installation_Guide/) to learn more about how to get this done.

## Install

Now that everything's set, I can boot on the USB key and follow the install wizard.
There's nothing to do in particular, I select my primary hard drive and erase everything from it.
Here again, [the documentation](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/23/html/Installation_Guide/) is helpful.

## Things to do _a posteriori_

I have now a basic system up and running, with only core packages installed.

But it is very likely that core packages are not enough for a specific usage.
At least it's not for me.

So here's the script I can run to get everything I need:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
#!/bin/bash

# let's be root first
su -

# first
dnf update

# mount the disks
mkdir /données # create mount point
echo -e "/dev/sda1 /données\t\text4 defaults" >> /etc/fstab # to mount the disk at startup
mount /données # mount the disk now

# backup
LATEST_BACKUP=$(ls /données | grep "Backup_" | sort | tail -n 1)
rsync -a $LATEST_BACKUP/* /home

# SSH
cp -r $LATEST_BACKUP/denis/.ssh /home/denis

# manage passwords
dnf install pass
git clone XX.XX.XX.XX:~/.password-store

# gnome-shell extensions

## Notes

- To mount a disk at startup, check [the official documentation](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/14/html/Storage_Administration_Guide/s3-disk-storage-parted-create-part-fstab.html).
- An interesting extension for Libreoffice is [Grammalect](http://www.dicollecte.org/grammalecte/telecharger.php), a powerfull check spelling.
- [rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) is also not available as a package yet.
